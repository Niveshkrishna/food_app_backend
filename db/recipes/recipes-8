Cook it in the usual way (using the instructions that are on the packet or included with the rice cooker). A rice cooker is recommended since it will be far more 'hands off' and will also free up more time to prepare the fillings. Estimate that one deciliter (1/2 cup) of uncooked rice will become about two larger onigiri or three smaller ones. While the rice is cooking, prepare the fillings. As you can see in the list above, there is wide latitude on what you can use as a filling. A few easy examples: Umeboshi: estimate one-two plums per onigiri. Squeeze out the stone, and you're done! Bonito Flakes: take a deciliter or so of the flakes, and pour a little soy sauce over it - it is very easy to pour too much, so be careful. Mix the flakes and the soy sauce until the flakes are moistened. Tuna: Take a can of tuna. Mix with a little mayonnaise - again, be sure you don't make it too wet. Add seasoning to taste; this can be chopped leeks, soy sauce, or chilies; sour or salty flavours work well.","quantity":null,"quantity_type":null},{"content":"Umeboshi: estimate one-two plums per onigiri.

It is a good idea to have a moderately large, clear workspace that is easy to clean afterwards. The rice is sticky, and you will end up getting it everywhere in the area. You need a bowl with salt water to rinse your fingers - the rice is sticky; also, the salty water enhances the flavour of the onigiri. Lastly, you will probably want to have some sheets of nori, though if you can't find it or don't like it, you can certainly do without. There are two options listed that can be used to make these items: Option 1 is to wet your hands in the salt water. Take two large spoonfuls of rice into one hand (carefully; the rice is hot), and gently squeeze and flatten it with the other. Make an indentation in the middle, and put some of the filling into the center. Be a little careful to get the filling only in the center and not all over the ball; that can make the rice less sticky, and stickiness is good. \"Fold\" the rice over the filling so it becomes covered. Squeeze gently, and mold it into a triangular shape by folding both your hands along the palms while keeping the fingers straight. Squeeze like that, rotating the ball a few times, and you will soon have a very neat triangle - this really is much harder to explain than to do. Once the ball is done, put it down on a clean surface to cool down. Rinse your hands and repeat. Option 2 is to use a bowl and some plastic film (saran wrap/cling wrap). Place about 2/3rds of the mixture into the centre of the cling wrap that has been draped into the bowl loosely. Then add approximately 2 teaspoons of filling (this is working off of about 3-4 portions per cup of rice. Then place the last 1/3 of the rice to the top. Then, mould the onigiri within the cling wrap. This drastically reduces mess and also is slightly more 'kid friendly'.","quantity":null,"quantity_type":null},{"content":"Option 1 is to wet your hands in the salt water.
