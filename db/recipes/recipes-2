If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning.

'Traditional' ham is ready at 80 °C but most take the ham out of the oven at 77 °C or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.","The use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. Thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water - it should show about 100 °C.","After you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer.
